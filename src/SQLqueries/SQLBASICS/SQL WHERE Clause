The WHERE Clause is used to filter records.
It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specific condition.

WHERE Syntax

SELECT column 1, column 2
FROM table_name
Where condition;

(Can be used in other statements like update , delete etc..”)

WHERE Clause Example
Select all customer from the country “mexico”.
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE country =‘Mexico’;


TEXT Fields vs Numeric fields
SQL requires single quotes around text values (most allow double quotes)
NUMERIC FIELDS SHOULD NOT ENCLOSED IN QUOTES!

SELECT *From Customers
WHERE CustomerId=1;

Operators in the WHERE Clause
The following operators can be used in the WHERE Clause:

=    equal
>    great than
<    less than
>=  greater than or equal
<=  Less than or equal
<>   Not Equal(!= can be used in some SQL versions)


BETWEEN   between a certain range

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price Between 50 AND 60;


LIKE  Search for a pattern

SELECT * FROM Customer
WHERE City LIKE ’s%’;


IN  To specify multiple possible values for a column

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City IN (‘Paris’ ‘London’);
