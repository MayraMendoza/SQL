SQL Aliases

SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, temporary name.

Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.

An alias only exists for the durability of the query.

An alias is created with the AS keyword.

Alias Column Sytax

SELECT Column_name AS alias_name
From table_name;

Alias Table Syntax
SELECT column_name(S)
FROM table_name AS alias_name;

Example
Create two aliases, one for the CustomerID column and one for the CustomerNameColumn:

SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS Customer
FROM Customers;

(If alias contains spaces double quotation marks or square brackets are required)

Example
SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS [Contact Person]
FROM Customers;


Example create a sql statement that creates an alias named “Address” that combine four columns
(Address, PostalCode, City and Country)

SELECT CustomerName, Address + ‘,’ + PostalCode + ‘ ‘ + city + ‘,’ +Country AS Address
FROM Customers;
