SQL JOINS

A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Example
SELECT Order.orderID , Customer.CustomerName, Order.orderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customer ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;


There are different types of joins
INNER JOIN - return records that have matching values in both (only matching values)
LEFT(OUTER) JOIN - returns all records from the left table and the matching tables from the right table.
RIGHT OUTER JOIN- returns all records from the right table, and the mated records from the left table
FULL OUTER JOIN - returns all records where there is a match in either left or right.

Exercise 1:
Inset the missing parts in the JOIN clause to join the two tables Orders and Customers, using the CustomerID field in both tables as the relationship between the two tables.

SELECT*
FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID = Customer.CustomerID


Exercise 2:
Choose the correct JOIN clause to select all the records from the sutlers table plus all the matches in the Orders table.

SELECT *
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Customers
ON Order.CustomerID= Customers.CustomerID;
