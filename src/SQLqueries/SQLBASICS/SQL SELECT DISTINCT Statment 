The SELECT DISTINCT stamens is used to return only distinct (different values).

Inside a table, a column often contain many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.

Example
SELECT DISTINCT column 1, column 2
FROM table_name;

SELET example without distinct (includes all duplicates)
SELECT country From customers;

This will return all countries even repeating ones.

Select DISTINCT Examples
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;
(This will return all the countries in the able once no multiples)

Following statement lists the number of different (distinct)customer countries:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) From Customer;
