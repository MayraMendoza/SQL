SQL TOP, LIMIT FETCH FIRST, OR ROWNUM clause

The SELECT TOP Clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.

SQL Server/MS
SELECT TOP number| percent column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Example select first 3 records from “customers”

SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;

TOP PERCENT EXAMPLE
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;

Exercise select top 3 record from customers table where counter is German

SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = ‘Germany’;
